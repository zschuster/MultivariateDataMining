The purpose of this file is to explore and visualize the ebola outbreaks during 2008 and 2009. The main two files being used are:

* historical_spread_points.shp
* historical_spread_polygons.shp


First read in the data

```{r}
ebolaPoints = readOGR(
  dsn = "~/Documents/BZAN552/MultivariateDataMining/shpFiles/points",
  layer = "historical_spread_points"
  )

ebolaPoly = readOGR(
  dsn = "~/Documents/BZAN552/MultivariateDataMining/shpFiles/polygons",
  layer = "historical_spread_polygons"
)

```
