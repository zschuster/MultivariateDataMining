# MultivariateDataMining

The pupose of this repository is to demonstrate three ad hoc analyses revolving around data mining topics, specifically unsupervised techniques. 

**The posts are broken down into the following three topics, with the sub bullets naming the final document for viewing within each topic.**

* Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
  * PCA_Impact.md
* Image compression via Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)
  * ImageCompression_via_SVD.ipynb
* Working with spatial data (not necesarilly an unsupervised technique!)
  * post_3_spatialData.md
